	abstract = {This book treats the central physical concepts and mathematical techniques used to investigate the dynamics of open quantum systems. To provide a self-contained presentation, the text begins with a survey of classical probability theory and with an introduction to the foundations of quantum mechanics, with particular emphasis on its statistical interpretation and on the formulation of generalized measurement theory through quantum operations and effects. The fundamentals of density matrix theory, quantum Markov processes, and completely positive dynamical semigroups are developed. The most important master equations used in quantum optics and condensed matter theory are derived and applied to the study of many examples. Special attention is paid to the Markovian and non-Markovian theory of environment induced decoherence, its role in the dynamical description of the measurement process, and to the experimental observation of decohering electromagnetic field states. The book includes the modern formulation of open quantum systems in terms of stochastic processes in Hilbert space. Stochastic wave function methods and Monte Carlo algorithms are designed and applied to important examples from quantum optics and atomic physics. The fundamentals of the treatment of non-Markovian quantum processes in open systems are developed on the basis of various mathematical techniques, such as projection superoperator methods and influence functional techniques. In addition, the book expounds the relativistic theory of quantum measurements and the density matrix theory of relativistic quantum electrodynamics.},

	abstract = {A general procedure is given for finding the equation of motion of the density matrix of a system in contact with a thermal bath, as for example a nuclear spin system weakly coupled to a crystal lattice. The thermal bath is treated both classically and quantum mechanically, and the theory is similar to, and a generalization of, conventional theories of time proportional transition probabilities. Relaxation of the system by the thermal bath is expressed by a linear matrix operator, and it is stressed that elements of this operator can be regarded as secular or nonsecular perturbations on the equation of motion and can be treated accordingly. When the motion of the system is slow compared to that of the thermal bath, the equation of motion can be expressed in an operator form which is independent of representation. If the system has a time-dependent Hamiltonian which varies slowly compared to the motion of the thermal bath, the same equation of motion is obeyed and the system is relaxed by the bath toward a Boltzmann distribution with respect to its instantaneous Hamiltonian. If the time variation of the Hamiltonian is more rapid, higher order corrections to the equation of motion must be applied. The theory is applied to spin-lattice relaxation of a coupled nuclear spin system in a metal, for arbitrary externally applied fixed magnetic field.},

Stochastic wave function methods and Monte Carlo algorithms are designed and applied to important examples from quantum optics and atomic physics, such as Levy statistics in the laser cooling of atoms, and the damped Jaynes-Cummings model. The basic features of the non-Markovian quantum behaviour of open systems are examined on the basis of projection operator techniques. In addition, the book expounds the relativistic theory of quantum measurements and discusses several examples from a unified perspective, e.g. non-local measurements and quantum teleportation. Influence functional and super-operator techniques are employed to study the density matrix theory in quantum electrodynamics and applications to the destruction of quantum coherence are presented. The text addresses graduate students and lecturers in physics and applied mathematics, as well as researchers with interests in fundamental questions in quantum mechanics and its applications. Many analytical methods and computer simulation techniques are developed and illustrated with the help of numerous specific examples. Only a basic understanding of quantum mechanics and of elementary concepts of probability theory is assumed.},

	abstract = {A simple model for time retarded fractional density and velocity hydrodynamic fluctuations correlations of a linear viscoelastic fluid under an external gradient is proposed. A fractional generalized Langevin equation with a Caputo’s fractional time derivative is formulated for a power-law memory kernel with long correlation noise. The fractional density and velocity fluctuations correlation functions, as well as the fractional light scattering spectra, and the fractional intermediate scattering function (FISF) are calculated analytically for power-law viscoelasticity. Their relation to the longitudinal modulus of the viscoelastic fluid is also obtained. We find that for different frequency intervals appropriate to perform isothermal light scattering experiments using Fabry–Perot interferometry and photon correlation, the non-equilibrium fractional structure factor may be smaller or larger than its fractional equilibrium values. We also discuss the validity of a fractional fluctuation–dissipation theorem for this model in terms of the asymptotic behavior of the equilibrium fractional correlation functions of the model.
We analyze the statistical averages over a set of realizations of the random variable in the Stochastic Optical Bloch equations, using Novikov's sufficient condition theorem. We consider a system on an adiabatic basis interacting with an external field in the presence of a thermal reservoir. We analyzed both for delta-correlated functions (white noise) and situations associated with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes (OUP) in colored noise. The effects of thermal reservoir and intramolecular coupling generate an effective transversal relaxation time. In the case of white noise, the resulting optical Bloch equations can be solved algebraically, unlike colored noise cases that requires numerical techniques.},

	abstract = {This textbook presents a systematic and unifying viewpoint for a wide class of nonlinear spectroscopic techniques in time domain and frequency domain. It is directed towards active researchers in physics, optics, chemistry, and materials science, as well as graduate students who enter thiscomplex and rapidly developing field. Nonlinear optical interactions of laser fields with matter provide powerful spectroscopic tools for the understanding of microscopic interactions and dynamic processes. One of the major obstacles facing researchers in this field, however, is the flood of experimental techniques and terminologies, which create a serious language barrier. The general microscopic correlation function approach to the nonlinear optical response developed in this book is essential for understanding the relationships among different techniques and a comparison of their information content, the design of newmeasurements, and for a systematic comparison of the optical response of different systems such as dyes in solutions, atoms and molecules in the gas phase, liquids, molecular aggregates and superlatives, and semiconductor nanostructures. The approach is based on formulating the nonlinear response byrepresenting the state of matter by the density matrix and following its evolution on Liouville space. Current active research areas such as femtosecond time-domain techniques, semi-classical and wave-packet dynamics, pulse shaping, pulse locking, exciton confinement, and the interplay ofelectronic, nuclear and field coherence are emphasized. The material has been developed from the author's highly successful interdisciplinary course at the University of Rochester attended by science and engineering graduate students},

Nonlinear signals are fully characterized by spectral interferometry. Starting from fundamental principles, we discuss the origin of phase stability and the precise calibration of excitation-pulse time delays using movable glass wedges. Automated subtraction of undesired scattering terms removes experimental artifacts. On the theoretical side, the response-function formalism is extended to describe molecules with three electronic levels, and the shape of 2D spectral features is discussed. As an example for this technique, experimental 2D spectra are shown for the dye molecule Nile Blue in acetonitrile at 595 nm, recorded for a series of population times. Simulations explore the influence of different model parameters and qualitatively reproduce the experimental results. We show that correlations between different electronically excited states can be determined from the spectra. The technique described here can be used to measure the third-order response function of complex systems covering several electronic transitions.},

	abstract = {Photosynthesis is a highly optimized process from which valuable lessons can be learned about the operating principles in nature. Its primary steps involve energy transport operating near theoretical quantum limits in efficiency. Recently, extensive research was motivated by the hypothesis that nature used quantum coherences to direct energy transfer. This body of work, a cornerstone for the field of quantum biology, rests on the interpretation of small-amplitude oscillations in two-dimensional electronic spectra of photosynthetic complexes. This Review discusses recent work reexamining these claims and demonstrates that interexciton coherences are too short lived to have any functional significance in photosynthetic energy transfer. Instead, the observed long-lived coherences originate from impulsively excited vibrations, generally observed in femtosecond spectroscopy. These efforts, collectively, lead to a more detailed understanding of the quantum aspects of dissipation. Nature, rather than trying to avoid dissipation, exploits it via engineering of exciton-bath interaction to create efficient energy flow.},

	abstract = {We compare four different types of equations of motion for reduced density matrix of a system of molecular excitons interacting with thermodynamic bath. All four equations are of second order in the linear system-bath interaction Hamiltonian, with different approximations applied in their derivation. In particular we compare time-nonlocal equations obtained from so-called Nakajima-Zwanzig identity and the time-local equations resulting from the partial ordering prescription of the cummulant expansion. In each of these equations we alternatively apply secular approximation to decouple population and coherence dynamics from each other. We focus on the dynamics of intraband electronic coherences of the excitonic system which can be traced by coherent two-dimensional spectroscopy. We discuss the applicability of the four relaxation theories to simulations of population and coherence dynamics, and identify features of the two-dimensional coherent spectrum that allow us to distinguish time-nonlocal effects.},

	abstract = {Some twelve years ago, Nature published an article reporting an evidence for wavelike energy transfer in the Fenna-Mattews-Olson complex, a small photosynthetic antenna isolated from green bacteria (Engel et al., 2007). In a broader sense, this publication marks a start of a complicated series of events, which constitute a part of what could be called a quantum revolution in biology. In this paper, we revisit the past decade of development in theoretical understanding of excitation energy transfer (EET) in photosynthesis under the influence of the new quantum vision of this field. In order to set the context, we review the status of the quantum theory of EET before the field has become a part of the broader discipline of quantum biology. We rephrase some of its former concepts in terms of decoherence theory and in the language of quasi-particles, to show the place, which theoretical photosynthesis research occupied in the big picture of quantum mechanics, physical chemistry and solid state physics before the supposed quantum revolution. We examine the influence of the new quantum-biological vocabulary, established over past ten years, on the development of the field. While the field has shown steady progress, directly related to the finds of Engel et al., we demonstrate that concepts ill-defined in the context of photosynthesis research, and imported from other branches of physics, actually hinder understanding of important natural photo-physical processes. Without providing suitable equivalent or added value, they threaten to replace concepts, which tie photosynthesis research to the related disciplines of chemistry and solid state physics. We demonstrate these claims by analyzing in some detail several recent paradigmatic papers from high profile journals.},
